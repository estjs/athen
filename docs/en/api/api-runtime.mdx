# Runtime API

import UsePageData from '../fragments/use-page-data.mdx';
import Content from '../fragments/content.mdx';
import RouteHook from '../fragments/route-hook.mdx';

import App from "./demo.jsx"

During theme development, we generally need the following key APIs to get the data or state of the page:

## usePageData

:::tip
`usePageData` is a Hook used to get the data of the current page.
:::

<UsePageData />

## Content

:::tip
`Content` is a Hook used to get the content of the current page.
:::

<Content />

## Route Hook

:::tip
`RouteHook` is a Hook used to get the routing information of the current page.
:::

<RouteHook />

## Example

`App` is an Essor component used to demonstrate the usage of key APIs during theme development.

<App />
