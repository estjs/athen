# Assets handle

## Import Static assets

You can import static assets in your `markdown`(or `mdx`) file, and Athen will handle it for you.

Relative and absolute paths are both supported. For example, if you have an image in the same folder as your markdown file, you can reference it like this:

```mdx
![](./athen.png)
```

Of course, in `mdx` file your can also use img tag directly:

```mdx
<img src="./athen.png" />
```

Athen will response the image request based on your source file path and the relative path you provided.

On the other hand, you can also use absolute path to import static assets.In this way, Athen will look for the file in two places:

- root dir served by Athen, such as `docs`
- public folder in root dir

For example, if root dir is `docs` and you have a file `docs/public/athen.png`, you can reference it like this:

```mdx
![](/athen.png)
```

Then, if you have a file `docs/assets/athen.png`, you can reference it like this:

```mdx
![](/assets/athen.png)
```

## Public Files

As well as mentioned above, you can put your static assets in `public` folder, and Athen will serve them for you. And in production build,
Athen will copy all files in `public` folder to the output folder(`dist`).

For example:

```bash
docs
├── public
│   └── athen.png
```

After build, you will get:

```bash
docs
├── public
│   └── athen.png
├── .athen
│   └── dist
│       └── athen.png
│       └── index.html
│       └── ...
```
